# Algorithm Analysis Laboratories üñ•Ô∏è

## Description
This repository contains the laboratories of the Algorithm Analysis course. Each directory corresponds to a specific laboratory.

## Repository Structure
### [Laboratory-01] (./main)
This C++ program presents the implementation of two sorting algorithms, Selection Sort and Bubble Sort, applied to a set of "car" objects. Each object represents a car with attributes such as brand, year of manufacture, and price.

### [Laboratory-02] (./main)
This laboratory presents the implementation of the Heap Sort sorting algorithm in C++. Heap Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm based on the minimum heap (min-heap) data structure. In this context, the lab uses an array of "Client" objects to illustrate the application of Heap Sort.

### [Laboratory-03] (./main)
This laboratory presents the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. The code defines a BinarySearchTree class that uses nodes to represent battalion data. Additionally, a set of functions are included to operate on the tree, such as insertion, deletion, and search.

### [Laboratory-04] (./main)
This lab implements a data structure known as Red-Black Tree (Red-Black Tree) in C++. This type of binary search tree maintains an automatic balance, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion complexity.

### [Laboratory-05] (./main)
This program solves the currency exchange problem using dynamic programming. The objective is to determine if it is possible to obtain a specific sum using a limited number of coins of different denominations.

### [Laboratory-06] (./main)
This repository houses solutions implemented in C++ for a series of problems that require the application of dynamic programming. The problems addressed involve various scenarios, from optimizing purchases in a supermarket to efficiently allocating resources to improve Pok√©mon statistics.

  -Problem 1: Maximizing Purchases at the Jam Store: This problem focuses on the optimal arrangement of jam jars on a shelf, considering customers' preferences for ingredients. Resolution involves identifying consecutive sequences that maximize the presence of the preferred ingredient.

  -Issue 2: Optimizing Pok√©mon Stats: In this scenario, improving Pok√©mon statistics through careful administration of vitamins is addressed. The challenge is to use different types of vitamins, each with its specific value, without exceeding the allowed improvement limit.

  -Problem 3: Casting Actors for a Film: The objective here is to select actors for a film strategically, maximizing prestige without exceeding the assigned budget. Assigning multiple roles to one actor is possible, providing additional flexibility in cast construction.
