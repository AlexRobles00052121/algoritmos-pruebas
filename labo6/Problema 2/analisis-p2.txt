formal definition

Entrance:
    G = Speed ​​limit (integer)
    V = Number of vitamins (integer)
    Boosts[] = Increase of each vitamin (integers)

Solution:
    Subset C of vitamins
    |C| = Amount of vitamins in the solution

Restrictions:
    Sum of vitamin increases in C ≤ G

PD related cases
    Coin Change Problem

Aim:
    Minimize |C|
    Subject to speed limit restriction

Analogy
    G limit equivalent to backpack size
    Each vitamin is an item with speed increase value
    We must maximize total speed with the least amount of vitamins

Optimal sub-problems

Let A(i, v) = Minimum amount of vitamins that give a total increase in v, considering the first i vitamins.

A(i, v) = Min { A(i-1, v), 1 + A(i - 1, v - Boosts(i)) }

By optimally calculating A(i, v) the global optimal solution is obtained.

Case of DP
-----------------

This vitamin optimization problem to improve the Pokémon's speed can also be modeled as a variant of the typical minimum coin change problem using Dynamic Programming.

The analogy is:

     The speed limit or meter is equivalent to the total amount for which change must be made.

     Each type of vitamin represents a different “currency denomination,” with a speed-up value.

     We can use each vitamin multiple times (as if we had infinite coins).

     The goal is to reach the speed limit (make full change) using the MINIMUM amount of vitamins (equivalent to the least amount of coins).
